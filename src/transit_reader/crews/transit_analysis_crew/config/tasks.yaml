  description: >
    Perform a comprehensive technical analysis of today's transiting planetary positions and configurations to provide complete structural and energetic data for downstream interpretive synthesis.

    **Critical Requirements**:
    - **Orb Precision**: Report ALL aspect orbs numerically with two decimal places (e.g., "Mars square Jupiter, Orb: 2.34°" NOT "tight orb" or "wide orb")
    - **Data Verification**: Cross-reference technical interpretations using the QdrantSearchTool to validate astrological symbolism against reference documents when encountering complex or rare configurations
    - **Prioritization**: If data exceeds reasonable scope, prioritize in this order:
        1. Tight aspects (<2°) involving outer planets or angles
        2. Stationing planets within ±5 days of station
        3. Stelliums (3+ planets within 10° in same sign) and major configurations (T-squares, Grand Trines, Yods)
        4. Chart shape and elemental/modal imbalances
        5. Other aspects and technical details

    Your objective is to systematically extract and prioritize:
    - Exact planetary positions: degree, sign, house (Placidus), motion (direct/retrograde), and essential dignity or debility.
    - Chart Shape Type: classify the current transit chart shape (Bundle, Bowl, Locomotive, etc.).
    - Diurnality: note whether the majority of transiting planets are above or below the horizon.
    - Significant transiting aspects among planets: prioritize conjunctions, oppositions, squares (within ~2° orb), and strong harmonic trines/sextiles where applicable.
        **MANDATORY**: For each aspect, explicitly state the exact orb measurement in this format: "Orb: X.XX°" (e.g., "Orb: 1.85°")
    - Geometric transit patterns formed by transiting planets (T-square, Grand Trine, Stellium, Yod).
    - Elemental (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and modality (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) distributions across the current chart.
    - Current Moon Phase and Moon's key aspects.
    - Any outer planets (Saturn–Pluto, Chiron) slowing, stationing, or recently stationing (within ±5 days).

    **Research Protocol**:
    - Use QdrantSearchTool to verify astrological interpretations for unfamiliar configurations
      - **Query Strategy**: Use SHORT, technical astrological terms ONLY (2-4 words maximum)
      - **GOOD queries**: "Saturn square Pluto", "T-square", "stellium Pisces", "Uranus station direct"
      - **BAD queries**: "Saturn square Pluto meaning", "T-square interpretation", "stellium in Pisces collective impact"
      - **Rule**: Omit words like "meaning", "interpretation", "collective", "impact" - use core astrological terms only
      - Integrate reference material insights to enrich technical accuracy

    Structure the findings logically in the following hierarchy:
    1. Planetary Positions (alphabetical or by planetary speed)
    2. Chart Shape and Diurnality Summary
    3. Transit-to-Transit Aspects with numerical orb measurements (MANDATORY: "Orb: X.XX°" format)
    4. Transit Geometric Patterns (if present)
    5. Elemental and Modality Distribution Summary
    6. Current Moon Phase and Key Aspects
    7. Stationing Outer Planets

    The transit date being analyzed is {transit_date}.
    The subject's name is {name}.
    Their current location is {location}.

    Current Transits data:

  expected_output: >
    A cleanly structured, degree-precise, and orb-prioritized summary of the current transiting planetary landscape, including chart shape, diurnality, elemental balance, Moon phase, stationing planets, with explicit numerical orb measurements for ALL aspects in "Orb: X.XX°" format, ready for downstream integration with natal analysis.

current_transits_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Analyze today's extracted transit data to identify collective psychological themes, archetypal patterns, emotional climates, and developmental tensions reflected by the current planetary configurations, without reference to the subject's natal chart.
    Ensure all explicitly noted transit factors are included in the synthesis.

    **Biographical Context Integration** (when provided):
    The subject may have provided biographical context describing their current life circumstances, developmental stage, active challenges, and emotional themes.
    When biographical context is available:
    - Use it to ground universal symbolic patterns in the subject's actual life situation
    - Highlight which collective themes are most likely to be personally resonant
    - Identify potential correspondences between transit symbolism and lived experience
    - Maintain symbolic universality - biographical context should anchor, not constrain interpretation
    - If no biographical context is provided, proceed with universal collective interpretation

    Subject's Biographical Context:
    {biographical_context}

    Interpretation Focus:
    - Synthesize current aspects, planetary conditions (dignities, retrogrades, speed changes), and geometric patterns into 2–4 major collective psychological or symbolic storylines.
    - Interpret the elemental and modality balance (Fire/Earth/Air/Water; Cardinal/Fixed/Mutable) to describe the dominant energetic climate and psychological tone.
    - Assess the emotional atmosphere implied by the Moon’s phase and key Lunar aspects to other transiting planets.
    - Identify any collective developmental tensions or opportunities suggested by:
        - Stationing planets
        - Heavy outer planet configurations
        - Transit stelliums clustering around sensitive points.
    - Frame the energetic atmosphere in psychological and symbolic terms (e.g., contraction, volatility, release, innovation) rather than forecasting specific external events.
    - Highlight areas of **collective friction, release, or opportunity** likely to color the emotional backdrop for personal and societal experiences.
    
    Output Instructions:
    - Organize findings under thematic headings: Collective Themes, Energetic Climate, Emotional Tone, Developmental Opportunities and Challenges.
    - Weave technical anchor points (e.g., specific aspects, stationing planets) naturally into symbolic narrative.
    - Maintain a psychologically rich, empowering, and technically precise tone.
    - Format in clean modular markdown with no code blocks.

    The transit date being analyzed is {transit_date}.
    The subject's name is {name}.
    Their current location is {location}.

    Subject's Biographical Context:
