current_transits_task:
  description: >
    Perform a comprehensive technical analysis of today's transiting planetary positions and configurations to provide complete structural and energetic data for downstream interpretive synthesis.

    Your objective is to systematically extract and prioritize:
    - Exact planetary positions: degree, sign, house (Placidus), motion (direct/retrograde), and essential dignity or debility.
    - Chart Shape Type: classify the current transit chart shape (Bundle, Bowl, Locomotive, etc.).
    - Diurnality: note whether the majority of transiting planets are above or below the horizon.
    - Significant transiting aspects among planets: prioritize conjunctions, oppositions, squares (within ~2° orb), and strong harmonic trines/sextiles where applicable.
    - Geometric transit patterns formed by transiting planets (T-square, Grand Trine, Stellium, Yod).
    - Elemental (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and modality (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) distributions across the current chart.
    - Current Moon Phase and Moon’s key aspects.
    - Any outer planets (Saturn–Pluto, Chiron) slowing, stationing, or recently stationing (within ±5 days).
    
    Structure the findings logically in the following hierarchy:
    1. Planetary Positions (alphabetical or by planetary speed)
    2. Chart Shape and Diurnality Summary
    3. Transit-to-Transit Aspects with orb measurements
    4. Transit Geometric Patterns (if present)
    5. Elemental and Modality Distribution Summary
    6. Current Moon Phase and Key Aspects
    7. Stationing Outer Planets

current_transits_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Analyze today's extracted transit data to identify collective psychological themes, archetypal patterns, emotional climates, and developmental tensions reflected by the current planetary configurations, without reference to the subject’s natal chart.
    Ensure all explicitly noted transit factors are included in the synthesis.

    Interpretation Focus:
    - Synthesize current aspects, planetary conditions (dignities, retrogrades, speed changes), and geometric patterns into 2–4 major collective psychological or symbolic storylines.
    - Interpret the elemental and modality balance (Fire/Earth/Air/Water; Cardinal/Fixed/Mutable) to describe the dominant energetic climate and psychological tone.
    - Assess the emotional atmosphere implied by the Moon’s phase and key Lunar aspects to other transiting planets.
    - Identify any collective developmental tensions or opportunities suggested by:
        - Stationing planets
        - Heavy outer planet configurations
        - Transit stelliums clustering around sensitive points.
    - Frame the energetic atmosphere in psychological and symbolic terms (e.g., contraction, volatility, release, innovation) rather than forecasting specific external events.
    - Highlight areas of **collective friction, release, or opportunity** likely to color the emotional backdrop for personal and societal experiences.
    
    Output Instructions:
    - Organize findings under thematic headings: Collective Themes, Energetic Climate, Emotional Tone, Developmental Opportunities and Challenges.
    - Weave technical anchor points (e.g., specific aspects, stationing planets) naturally into symbolic narrative.
    - Maintain a psychologically rich, empowering, and technically precise tone.
    - Format in clean modular markdown with no code blocks.

  expected_output: >
    A structured, psychologically insightful interpretation of today's collective astrological landscape, mapping major collective archetypal themes, emotional climates, and developmental opportunities, formatted in clean modular markdown for downstream integration.
