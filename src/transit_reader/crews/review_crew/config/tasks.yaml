report_review_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a full-spectrum quality review of the finalized astrological report to ensure it meets the highest standards of technical accuracy, psychological depth, thematic coherence, and reader accessibility.

    **Technical Verification Protocol**:
    You have been provided with the raw chart data (transit_chart, natal_chart, transit_to_natal_chart) and the analysis documents (transit_analysis, natal_analysis, transit_to_natal_analysis). Use these to perform rigorous technical verification.

    **Mandatory Verification Steps**:
    - Cross-reference ALL planetary positions mentioned in the report against the provided transit_chart, natal_chart, and transit_to_natal_chart raw data
    - Verify aspect orbs are stated numerically in "Orb: X.XX°" format (e.g., "Orb: 2.34°"), NOT vaguely (e.g., "tight orb", "wide aspect")
    - Confirm transit-to-natal aspects exist in the transit_to_natal_chart data with correct degrees and aspect types
    - Check for mathematical errors in house cusps, planetary positions, or orb calculations
    - Verify that applying/separating status is stated for transit-to-natal aspects where relevant
    - Use QdrantSearchTool to spot-check interpretations against established astrological literature when uncertain about symbolic accuracy
      - **Query Strategy**: Use SHORT, technical astrological terms ONLY (2-4 words maximum)
      - **GOOD queries**: "Neptune square Mercury", "Grand Trine water", "Chiron return"
      - **BAD queries**: "Neptune square Mercury interpretation validity", "Grand Trine in water signs meaning"
      - **Rule**: Omit words like "interpretation", "meaning", "validity" - use core astrological terms only

    Review Focus:
    - **Technical Validation**:
      - Verify all planetary positions, aspects, dignities, house placements, and transit-to-natal activations against the provided chart data (transit_chart, natal_chart, transit_to_natal_chart).
      - Confirm timing arcs (start, peak, culmination) for major transits and returns are accurately represented.
      - Explicitly check that ALL aspect orb measurements are stated numerically in "Orb: X.XX°" format. Flag any vague descriptors like "tight", "moderate", "wide" as violations requiring correction.
      - Verify clarity and accuracy of nodal house references and angular planet positions.
    - **Interpretive Integrity**:
      - Assess the consistent application of classical, modern, and psychological astrological frameworks.
      - Confirm correct prioritization: long-term outers, angles, returns, and tight aspects over minor influences.
      - Evaluate the depth of psychological and archetypal interpretation, ensuring it goes beyond surface-level keywords.
      - Cross-check major interpretations against analysis documents (transit_analysis, natal_analysis, transit_to_natal_analysis) for consistency.
    - **Narrative Coherence**:
      - Ensure clear sequencing: Executive Summary ➔ Introduction ➔ Transit Climate ➔ Natal Foundations ➔ Personalized Themes ➔ Working With This Energy ➔ Technical Overview ➔ Actionable Guidance ➔ Conclusion.
      - Validate that thematic arcs are logical, interconnected, and flow naturally across sections.
      - Assess how well the interaction between the main developmental themes is synthesized.
      - Verify explicit transitional sentences between major sections that:
          - Reference specific upcoming chart themes (not generic bridging language)
          - Create narrative continuity by linking the previous section's conclusion to the next section's opening
          - Acknowledge the reader's journey through complex material with specific encouragement
      - Flag any section boundaries that lack contextual connective tissue
    - **Emotional Resonance and Accessibility**:
      - Evaluate emotional tone: is it empowering, psychologically intelligent, and non-deterministic?
      - Confirm technical details are embedded fluently without disrupting readability.
      - Explicitly check if challenging aspects/periods are framed as opportunities for growth.
      - Assess whether real-world relevance and timing strategies are clearly conveyed for varying experience levels.
      - Verify Executive Summary provides clear, accessible entry point with plain-language essence, key dates, and emotional weather forecast.
      - Check that each developmental theme includes "Questions for Reflection" (3-4 prompts) that:
          - Are anchored to specific chart symbolism (sign, planet, house) mentioned in the theme
          - Rotate between awareness, emotional, behavioral, and timing question types
          - Avoid generic therapeutic language (flag questions that could apply to any chart)
          - Include at least one question referencing the specific archetypal tension (e.g., Saturn-Pluto = discipline vs. transformation)
      - Check that each developmental theme includes "Real-World Signals" (3-5 concrete scenarios/markers).
      - Confirm "Working With This Energy" section includes quick-start practices, emergency protocols, and daily micro-practices.
      - Assess conversational bridging language—does it acknowledge complexity, offer reassurance, and remind readers of their agency?
    - **Language Precision and Professionalism**:
      - Flag vague qualifiers: Replace "can," "may," "often" with "typically," "tends to," "characteristically," "compels"
      - Identify passive constructions: Change "is being tested" to "tests your assumptions," "you may be pushed" to "compels you to"
      - Check for repetitive metaphors: Flag "crucible," "alchemy," "compost" used more than once per major theme; suggest concrete terms instead
      - Verify sentence length: Flag sentences over 40 words; suggest breaking for clarity
      - Confirm orb-interpretation links: Tight orbs (< 1°) must explicitly connect to immediacy/intensity
      - Validate planet-guidance connections: All guidance must reference activating planets (e.g., "Under Pluto's conjunction to Mercury...")
      - Check for micro-headers: Dense theme sections should have "Technical Summary," "Psychological Implications," "Practical Expression"
      - Verify context lines: Guidance blocks should include brief italicized orienting context
      - Confirm technical glosses: Terms like "Out of Bounds," "Vertex," "Applying/Separating" should be defined once in parentheticals
    - **Technical Formatting Consistency**:
      - Orb precision: Verify all orbs use two decimal places (e.g., "Orb: 3.45°" not "Orb: 3.4°")
      - Degree symbol: Check for correct ° symbol (not 0°) with no space before it (e.g., "14° Leo" not "14 ° Leo")
      - Planet order syntax: Verify consistent "Transit Planet → Natal Planet, Orb: X.XX°, Applying/Separating"
      - Causal continuity: Growth potentials must reflect exact symbolic tensions (e.g., "discipline versus transformation" for Saturn-Pluto, not generic psychology)
    - **Metaphor and Symbolic Language Audit**:
      - Count archetypal metaphors: Flag if "threshold," "alchemy," "crucible," "metamorphosis," "journey," "crossroads" appear more than once per developmental theme
      - Identify LLM pattern artifacts: Flag repetitive symbolic framings that lack chart-specific context
      - Verify psychological language diversity: Check that interpretations use varied vocabulary (not just recycled mystical terms)
      - Suggest process-based alternatives when metaphors are overused

    Critique Instructions:
    - Organize feedback under clear headings: Technical Accuracy, Interpretive Integrity, Narrative Coherence, Emotional Resonance and Accessibility, Language Precision and Professionalism, Technical Formatting Consistency, Metaphor and Symbolic Language Audit.
    - Provide specific, actionable bullet points under each heading.
    - Remain concise, discerning, and solution-focused — no rewriting.
    - Maintain a solution-focused tone: identify weaknesses or missed opportunities, but offer guidance for refinement without rewriting or reinterpreting.

report_enhancement_task:
  description: >
    Refine, deepen, and polish the finalized astrological report based on structured critique feedback, ensuring complete alignment with the modular report structure and maximizing psychological, technical, and practical excellence.

    **CRITICAL: Mandatory Report Structure to Preserve**:
    The report MUST maintain this exact section sequence and structure:
    1. **Cover Page** (Name, Birth Data, Current Location, Report Date, '[transit_chart]' placeholder)
    2. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentence compression, key dates, theme one-liners, emotional weather forecast)
    3. **Introduction** (purpose, astrology as symbolic tool, warm invitational language)
    4. **Transit Climate Overview** (collective patterns, elemental/modality emphasis, Moon phase, explicit transition to personal chart)
    5. **Subject's Natal Foundation** (dominant traits, elemental/modality balance, configurations, explicit transition to transit themes)
    6. **Personalized Developmental Themes (Transit-to-Natal Focus)** (2-4 themes, each with: Title, Activation details, Interpretation with situational specificity, Questions for Reflection [3-4, chart-anchored], Real-World Signals [3-5 scenarios], Timing arcs)
    7. **Working With This Energy** (quick-start practices, emergency protocols, daily micro-practices, resource types)
    8. **Technical Overview for Active Themes** (tabular/bullet-point technical summary)
    9. **Actionable Life Guidance** (1-3 recommendations per theme, timing sensitivity, framed as choices)
    10. **Conclusion** (synthesize theme interactions, reflect on meta-pattern, specific agency reinforcement, forward-looking timing acknowledgment)

    DO NOT:
    - Reorder sections
    - Merge sections
    - Remove sections
    - Add new major sections not listed above
    - Change section numbering or hierarchy

    Enhancement Focus:
    - Expand and deepen psychological insight where critiques highlight gaps, particularly within personalized Transit-to-Natal developmental arcs.
    - Strengthen narrative coherence across all major report sections:
      - Transit Climate Overview
      - Subject's Natal Foundations
      - Personalized Growth Themes
      - Technical Overview
      - Actionable Life Guidance
    - Ensure each Personalized Theme:
      - Is fully linked to exact transits, aspects, degrees, houses.
      - Includes estimated timing arcs (start, peak, resolution).
      - Embeds life-domain activation and practical relevance.
    - Enrich symbolic metaphors, real-world examples, and psychologically empowering language without disrupting technical accuracy.
    - Smooth narrative transitions between sections while preserving modular structure and thematic sequencing.
    - Maintain clear, empowering emotional tone suitable for intermediate-to-advanced readers without oversimplifying astrological symbolism.

    Enhancement Guidelines:
    1. **Planning First**:
        - Read the full report and the structured critique carefully.
        - Identify specific sections requiring expansion, clarification, thematic reinforcement, or timing refinement.
        - Prioritize edits that enhance developmental arcs, technical anchoring, psychological richness, and practical application.
    2. **Enhance with Precision**:
        - Expand interpretations only where feedback indicates underdevelopment or potential enrichment.
        - Use verified technical data (planet, degree, house, aspect) to ground all new insights and metaphoric framing.
        - Integrate emotional nuance, archetypal symbolism, and real-world strategies tied to active life domains.
        - When adding "Questions for Reflection": MUST anchor to specific chart symbolism (sign, planet, house); rotate question types (awareness, emotional, behavioral, timing); avoid generic therapeutic language
        - When enhancing "Practical Expression": Add 1-2 situational manifestations linking planet, house, aspect (e.g., "tensions with authority figures reflecting natal Saturn square Pluto activated by transiting Uranus")
    3. **Maintain Voice and Flow**:
        - Preserve the original emotional tone and narrative style.
        - Avoid duplicating existing content or introducing new chart points unless justified by critique.
        - Ensure fluent integration of technical information into readable narrative arcs.
    4. **Language and Metaphor Discipline**:
        - Apply metaphor limits: "threshold," "alchemy," "crucible," "metamorphosis," "journey," "crossroads" MAXIMUM once per developmental theme
        - Substitute with process-based language: "integration phase," "reorganization," "emergence pattern," "consolidation period," "catalytic tension"
        - Replace self-help idioms: "Trust yourself" → "Your capacity for self-assessment remains reliable"; "Allow uncertainty" → "Uncertainty characterizes this phase—maintain flexibility"
        - Add imperative justifications: Link directives to specific transits (e.g., "Maintain planning flexibility [Neptune squares Mercury through June]")
        - Vary sentence openings: Limit "This is a time..." (max 2), "These steps..." (max 2), "You may..." (rephrase to "You'll likely," "Expect to")
    5. **Transition Enhancement**:
        - Add explicit transitional sentences between major sections that reference specific chart themes
        - Link previous section's conclusion to next section's opening
        - Create narrative continuity with chart-specific context (not generic bridging)

    Special Instructions:
    - Insert the standardized placeholder '[transit_chart]' immediately after the Cover Page header.
    - Do not invent or speculate beyond validated transit, natal, or transit-to-natal data.
    - Maintain clean modular markdown formatting without code blocks, notes, or meta-commentary.
    - Ensure every main section and each developmental theme is logically headed and internally consistent.

    Output Instructions:
    - Deliver a fully polished, psychologically sophisticated, technically rigorous astrological report, ready for client delivery.
    - Follow the modular sectioning and narrative arc outlined in the enhanced report structure.
