  description: >
    Conduct a full-spectrum quality review of the finalized astrological report to ensure it meets the highest standards of technical accuracy, psychological depth, thematic coherence, and reader accessibility.

    **Technical Verification Protocol** (ENHANCED):
    You have been provided with the raw chart data (transit_chart, natal_chart, transit_to_natal_chart) and the analysis documents (transit_analysis, natal_analysis, transit_to_natal_analysis). Use these to perform rigorous technical verification.

    **Mandatory Verification Steps**:
    - Cross-reference ALL planetary positions mentioned in the report against the provided transit_chart, natal_chart, and transit_to_natal_chart raw data
    - Verify aspect orbs are stated numerically in "Orb: X.XX°" format (e.g., "Orb: 2.34°"), NOT vaguely (e.g., "tight orb", "wide aspect")
    - Confirm transit-to-natal aspects exist in the transit_to_natal_chart data with correct degrees and aspect types
    - Check for mathematical errors in house cusps, planetary positions, or orb calculations
    - Verify that applying/separating status is stated for transit-to-natal aspects where relevant
    - Use QdrantSearchTool to spot-check interpretations against established astrological literature when uncertain about symbolic accuracy

    Review Focus:
    - **Technical Validation**:
      - Verify all planetary positions, aspects, dignities, house placements, and transit-to-natal activations against the provided chart data (transit_chart, natal_chart, transit_to_natal_chart).
      - Confirm timing arcs (start, peak, culmination) for major transits and returns are accurately represented.
      - **CRITICAL**: Explicitly check that ALL aspect orb measurements are stated numerically in "Orb: X.XX°" format. Flag any vague descriptors like "tight", "moderate", "wide" as violations requiring correction.
      - Verify clarity and accuracy of nodal house references and angular planet positions.
    - **Interpretive Integrity**:
      - Assess the consistent application of classical, modern, and psychological astrological frameworks.
      - Confirm correct prioritization: long-term outers, angles, returns, and tight aspects over minor influences.
      - Evaluate the depth of psychological and archetypal interpretation, ensuring it goes beyond surface-level keywords.
      - Cross-check major interpretations against analysis documents (transit_analysis, natal_analysis, transit_to_natal_analysis) for consistency.
    - **Narrative Coherence**:
      - Ensure clear sequencing: Transit Climate ➔ Natal Foundations ➔ Transit-to-Natal Activations ➔ Practical Guidance.
      - Validate that thematic arcs are logical, interconnected, and flow naturally across sections.
      - Assess how well the interaction between the main developmental themes is synthesized.
    - **Emotional Resonance and Accessibility**:
      - Evaluate emotional tone: is it empowering, psychologically intelligent, and non-deterministic?
      - Confirm technical details are embedded fluently without disrupting readability.
      - Explicitly check if challenging aspects/periods are framed as opportunities for growth.
      - Assess whether real-world relevance and timing strategies are clearly conveyed for varying experience levels.

    Critique Instructions:
    - Organize feedback under clear headings: Technical Accuracy, Interpretive Integrity, Narrative Coherence, Emotional Resonance and Accessibility.
    - Provide specific, actionable bullet points under each heading.
    - Remain concise, discerning, and solution-focused — no rewriting.
    - Maintain a solution-focused tone: identify weaknesses or missed opportunities, but offer guidance for refinement without rewriting or reinterpreting.

report_enhancement_task:
  description: >
    Refine, deepen, and polish the finalized astrological report based on structured critique feedback, ensuring complete alignment with the enhanced modular report structure and maximizing psychological, technical, and practical excellence.

    Enhancement Focus:
    - Expand and deepen psychological insight where critiques highlight gaps, particularly within personalized Transit-to-Natal developmental arcs.
    - Strengthen narrative coherence across all major report sections:
      - Transit Climate Overview
      - Subject's Natal Foundations
      - Personalized Growth Themes
      - Technical Overview
      - Actionable Life Guidance
    - Ensure each Personalized Theme:
      - Is fully linked to exact transits, aspects, degrees, houses.
      - Includes estimated timing arcs (start, peak, resolution).
      - Embeds life-domain activation and practical relevance.
    - Enrich symbolic metaphors, real-world examples, and psychologically empowering language without disrupting technical accuracy.
    - Smooth narrative transitions between sections while preserving modular structure and thematic sequencing.
    - Maintain clear, empowering emotional tone suitable for intermediate-to-advanced readers without oversimplifying astrological symbolism.

    Enhancement Guidelines:
    1. **Planning First**:
        - Read the full report and the structured critique carefully.
        - Identify specific sections requiring expansion, clarification, thematic reinforcement, or timing refinement.
        - Prioritize edits that enhance developmental arcs, technical anchoring, psychological richness, and practical application.
    2. **Enhance with Precision**:
        - Expand interpretations only where feedback indicates underdevelopment or potential enrichment.
        - Use verified technical data (planet, degree, house, aspect) to ground all new insights and metaphoric framing.
        - Integrate emotional nuance, archetypal symbolism, and real-world strategies tied to active life domains.
    3. **Maintain Voice and Flow**:
        - Preserve the original emotional tone and narrative style.
        - Avoid duplicating existing content or introducing new chart points unless justified by critique.
        - Ensure fluent integration of technical information into readable narrative arcs.

    Special Instructions:
    - Insert the standardized placeholder '[transit_chart]' immediately after the Cover Page header.
    - Do not invent or speculate beyond validated transit, natal, or transit-to-natal data.
    - Maintain clean modular markdown formatting without code blocks, notes, or meta-commentary.
    - Ensure every main section and each developmental theme is logically headed and internally consistent.

    Output Instructions:
    - Deliver a fully polished, psychologically sophisticated, technically rigorous astrological report, ready for client delivery.
    - Follow the modular sectioning and narrative arc outlined in the enhanced report structure.
