transits_to_natal_interpretation_critic_task:
  description: >
    Critically review the provided transit-to-natal interpretation for full technical accuracy, psychological richness, thematic coherence, developmental framing, and actionable timing relevance, based exclusively on embedded data and established astrological best practices.

    Critique Focus:
    - **Technical Anchoring**:
      - Verify that all interpretations are correctly grounded in specific transit-to-natal aspects, degrees, orb tightness, house activations, planetary dignities, and motion states.
      - Confirm that applying/separating aspect status and retrograde effects are accurately reflected where relevant.
    - **Psychological Depth**:
      - Evaluate whether each developmental theme explores internal growth dynamics and frames life domains meaningfully.
      - Check that planetary archetypes are interpreted symbolically, not superficially or deterministically.
    - **Thematic and Narrative Coherence**:
      - Assess the logical integration of simultaneous transits into unified psychological growth arcs.
      - Verify that activated houses and life domains are meaningfully tied to the developmental storyline.
    - **Timing Clarity and Arc Mapping**:
      - Ensure that each major activation specifies clear timing windows (onset, peak, resolution) and appropriately references stations, retrogrades, or multiple transit passes.
    - **Emotional Resonance and Ethical Framing**:
      - Confirm that the emotional tone remains empowering, psychologically intelligent, and supportive of conscious agency.
      - Guard against deterministic, pathologizing, or fear-based interpretations.

    Critique Instructions:
    - Structure feedback under clear headings:
        - Technical Accuracy
        - Psychological Depth
        - Thematic Coherence
        - Timing Clarity
        - Emotional Resonance
    - Provide targeted, actionable bullet-point recommendations under each heading.
    - Remain concise, discerning, and solution-focused — no rewriting or adding interpretation content yourself.
    - Maintain a solution-focused tone: identify weaknesses or missed opportunities, but offer guidance for refinement without rewriting or reinterpreting.

transits_to_natal_interpretation_enhancement_task:
  description: >
    Refine and enrich the provided transit-to-natal interpretation based on the structured critique, enhancing technical precision, psychological depth, thematic cohesion, and practical relevance while preserving the original emotional tone and narrative voice.

    **IMPORTANT**: All necessary chart data is provided below as reference. DO NOT search for additional chart information externally. Verify all technical details against the raw transit-to-natal chart data provided.

    Enhancement Focus:
    - Deepen psychological interpretations where critiques identify underdevelopment, ensuring rich archetypal exploration and meaningful internal growth narratives.
    - Strengthen thematic synthesis across multiple transit activations into coherent developmental arcs, respecting timing sequences and house activations.
    - Integrate empowering symbolic metaphors, relatable life examples, and practical developmental framing, precisely tied to verified transit-to-natal technical data.
    - Clarify or enrich timing arcs (onset, peak, resolution) where needed, reflecting planetary motion (direct/retrograde/station).
    - Maintain accessible yet psychologically sophisticated language: explaining complex dynamics without oversimplification or generalization.

    Enhancement Instructions:
    - Expand or revise only the areas highlighted by the structured critique.
    - Do not introduce new planetary activations, houses, or speculative events unless explicitly requested or clearly implied by the critique.
    - Preserve the report’s modular markdown structure, thematic sequence, and emotionally empowering voice.

    Output Instructions:
    - Deliver the fully enhanced interpretation in clean, modular markdown (no code blocks, no meta-commentary).
    - Ensure logical headings, fluent thematic transitions, and seamless psychological integration throughout.
