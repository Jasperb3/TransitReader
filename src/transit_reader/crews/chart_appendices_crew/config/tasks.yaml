combined_appendices_task:
  description: >
    Compile the three individual chart appendices (Transit, Natal, Transit-to-Natal) from the preceding task outputs into a single, cohesively formatted "Appendices" section ready for insertion into the final report markdown.

    **Context Available**: You have access to the outputs of the three preceding appendix generation tasks. These contain the structured appendices for Transit Chart, Natal Chart, and Transit-to-Natal interactions.

    **Critical Requirements**:
    - **Master Heading**: Begin with "# Appendices" (H1 level)
    - **Subheadings**: Format each appendix as H2 (##):
        - ## Appendix A: Transit Chart Details
        - ## Appendix B: Natal Chart Details
        - ## Appendix C: Transit-to-Natal Interaction Details
    - **Consistent Formatting**: Ensure all three appendices follow the same structural patterns
    - **Clean Markdown**: No code blocks, no meta-commentary, ready for direct markdown insertion
    - **Navigation**: Maintain clear hierarchical structure for easy reference lookup
    - **Completeness**: Include all three appendices in their entirety

    **Compilation Instructions**:
    - Take the outputs from the three preceding tasks (transit_chart_appendix_task, natal_chart_appendix_task, transit_to_natal_appendix_task)
    - Add the master "# Appendices" heading
    - Add H2 (##) subheadings for each appendix section (Appendix A, B, C)
    - Preserve all internal structure (H3, H4, tables, lists) from each appendix
    - Ensure consistent spacing and formatting between sections
    - Verify markdown syntax is clean and valid
    - NO additional narrative or introduction - just structured reference data

    **Output Format Example**:
    # Appendices

    ## Appendix A: Transit Chart Details
    [Full transit appendix content from first task]

    ## Appendix B: Natal Chart Details
    [Full natal appendix content from second task]

    ## Appendix C: Transit-to-Natal Interaction Details
    [Full transit-to-natal appendix content from third task]

  expected_output: >
    A complete, cohesively formatted "Appendices" section in clean markdown with master H1 heading and three H2 subsections (Transit, Natal, Transit-to-Natal), preserving all hierarchical structure and technical data, ready for direct insertion into the final report markdown.
