natal_chart_reading_task:
  description: >
    Perform a comprehensive technical extraction of the subject's natal chart, capturing all fundamental structural elements with degree-perfect accuracy to support downstream developmental synthesis.

    **Critical Requirements**:
    - **Orb Precision**: Report ALL aspect orbs numerically with two decimal places (e.g., "Sun square Moon, Orb: 3.45°" NOT "moderate orb")
    - **Angular Precision**: For angular planets, state exact degree separation (e.g., "Mars conjunct ASC, 2.18° from exact")
    - **Data Verification**: Use QdrantSearchTool to verify interpretation of rare configurations (e.g., Yods, Mystic Rectangles, unusual aspect patterns)
    - **Prioritization**: If chart is complex, prioritize:
        1. Tight aspects (<3°) to angles, luminaries (Sun/Moon), and chart ruler
        2. Major configurations (T-squares, Grand Trines, Yods)
        3. Stelliums and angular planets
        4. Wider aspects and secondary patterns

    Extraction Guidelines:
    - List planetary, asteroid, and sensitive point positions: exact zodiac degree, zodiac sign, house placement (Placidus system), motion (direct/retrograde if applicable), essential dignity/debility, and sect status (day/night chart).
    - Identify major natal aspects between planets/points: prioritize conjunctions, oppositions, squares, trines, and sextiles within 8° orb (tighten to 5° for luminaries and sensitive points).
        **MANDATORY**: For each aspect, explicitly state the exact orb measurement in this format: "Orb: X.XX°" (e.g., "Orb: 3.45°")
    - Map major configuration patterns: T-squares, Grand Trines, Yods, Mystic Rectangles, Stelliums (3+ planets within 10° and same sign or house).
    - Summarize elemental distribution (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and modality distribution (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable).
    - Classify chart shape based on planetary distribution (Bundle, Bowl, Locomotive, Splash, etc.).
    - Identify diurnality: note whether the chart is a day chart (Sun above horizon) or night chart (Sun below horizon).
    - Determine natal Moon phase and list Sun-Moon angular relationship (New, Crescent, First Quarter, Gibbous, Full, Disseminating, Last Quarter, Balsamic).
    - Note angular planets: planets conjunct ASC, DSC, MC, IC within 5° orb (list planet, angle, exact degree separation in "X.XX°" format).

    **Research Protocol**:
    - Use QdrantSearchTool when encountering unusual patterns or configurations
    - **Query Strategy**: Use SHORT, technical astrological terms ONLY (2-4 words maximum)
    - **GOOD queries**: "Yod configuration", "Mystic Rectangle", "Saturn peregrine", "Mars combust"
    - **BAD queries**: "Yod configuration natal meaning", "Mystic Rectangle psychological interpretation"
    - **Rule**: Omit words like "meaning", "interpretation", "natal", "psychological" - use core astrological terms only

    Structure the findings hierarchically:
    1. Planetary and Sensitive Point Positions Table
    2. Natal Major Aspects Table (with mandatory "Orb: X.XX°" for each aspect)
    3. Configuration Patterns Overview
    4. Elemental and Modal Balance Summary
    5. Chart Shape, Diurnality, and Moon Phase

    No interpretation or subjective commentary at this stage — strictly technical extraction with precise numerical measurements.

natal_chart_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the extracted natal chart structure to uncover the subject's core psychological themes, symbolic life potentials, and developmental arcs, following humanistic, archetypal, and psychological astrological principles.
    Ensure deeper archetypal exploration rooted in specific natal placements and configurations.

    Interpretation Guidelines:
    - Extract 2–4 dominant psychological archetypes or growth themes rooted in strong planetary placements, aspect configurations, and house concentrations.
    - Analyze elemental and modality balance for core temperament and habitual style (e.g., emotionally fluid, intellectually dominant, practically stabilizing).
    - Interpret the natal Moon phase for emotional development style and instinctual growth trajectory.
    - Extract the symbolic developmental narrative suggested by any major configurations (if applicable), e.g.:
        - T-squares (inner tension and evolution)
        - Grand Trines (natural flow and potential inertia)
        - Yods (destiny themes, adjustment challenges)
    - Contextualize angular planets and dignified/debilitated planets in terms of core life priorities, psychological emphasis, or growth pressures.
    - Weight interpretations appropriately for sect: recognize altered strength of malefics/benefics in day/night charts.
    - Identify any strong planetary clusters (stelliums) as psychological complexes or focalizing factors.
    - Frame all interpretations in psychologically empowering, developmental language focused on potentials and conscious growth — avoid deterministic trait assignment.

    Output Instructions:
    - Organize under clear thematic headings:
        - Temperament Overview
        - Core Psychological Archetypes
        - Emotional Development and Moon Phase Insights
        - Key Developmental Challenges and Opportunities
        - Psychological Resources and Strengths
    - Write in clean, structured markdown without code blocks.
    - Interpret only the chart features extracted by the reader task — do not invent or extrapolate beyond verified technical data.
