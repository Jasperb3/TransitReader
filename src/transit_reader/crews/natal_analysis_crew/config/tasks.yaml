natal_chart_reading_task:
  description: >
    Perform a comprehensive technical extraction of the subject's natal chart, capturing all fundamental structural elements with degree-perfect accuracy to support downstream developmental synthesis.

    Extraction Guidelines:
    - List planetary, asteroid, and sensitive point positions: exact zodiac degree, zodiac sign, house placement (Placidus system), motion (direct/retrograde if applicable), essential dignity/debility, and sect status (day/night chart).
    - Identify major natal aspects between planets/points: prioritize conjunctions, oppositions, squares, trines, and sextiles within 8° orb (tighten to 5° for luminaries and sensitive points).
    - Map major configuration patterns: T-squares, Grand Trines, Yods, Mystic Rectangles, Stelliums (3+ planets within 10° and same sign or house).
    - Summarize elemental distribution (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and modality distribution (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable).
    - Classify chart shape based on planetary distribution (Bundle, Bowl, Locomotive, Splash, etc.).
    - Identify diurnality: note whether the chart is a day chart (Sun above horizon) or night chart (Sun below horizon).
    - Determine natal Moon phase and list Sun-Moon angular relationship (New, Crescent, First Quarter, Gibbous, Full, Disseminating, Last Quarter, Balsamic).
    - Note angular planets: planets conjunct ASC, DSC, MC, IC within 5° orb (list planet, angle, degree separation).

    Structure the findings hierarchically:
    1. Planetary and Sensitive Point Positions Table
    2. Natal Major Aspects Table
    3. Configuration Patterns Overview
    4. Elemental and Modal Balance Summary
    5. Chart Shape, Diurnality, and Moon Phase

    No interpretation or subjective commentary at this stage — strictly technical extraction.

natal_chart_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the extracted natal chart structure to uncover the subject's core psychological themes, symbolic life potentials, and developmental arcs, following humanistic, archetypal, and psychological astrological principles.
    Ensure deeper archetypal exploration rooted in specific natal placements and configurations.

    Interpretation Guidelines:
    - Extract 2–4 dominant psychological archetypes or growth themes rooted in strong planetary placements, aspect configurations, and house concentrations.
    - Analyze elemental and modality balance for core temperament and habitual style (e.g., emotionally fluid, intellectually dominant, practically stabilizing).
    - Interpret the natal Moon phase for emotional development style and instinctual growth trajectory.
    - Extract the symbolic developmental narrative suggested by any major configurations (if applicable), e.g.:
        - T-squares (inner tension and evolution)
        - Grand Trines (natural flow and potential inertia)
        - Yods (destiny themes, adjustment challenges)
    - Contextualize angular planets and dignified/debilitated planets in terms of core life priorities, psychological emphasis, or growth pressures.
    - Weight interpretations appropriately for sect: recognize altered strength of malefics/benefics in day/night charts.
    - Identify any strong planetary clusters (stelliums) as psychological complexes or focalizing factors.
    - Frame all interpretations in psychologically empowering, developmental language focused on potentials and conscious growth — avoid deterministic trait assignment.

    Output Instructions:
    - Organize under clear thematic headings:
        - Temperament Overview
        - Core Psychological Archetypes
        - Emotional Development and Moon Phase Insights
        - Key Developmental Challenges and Opportunities
        - Psychological Resources and Strengths
    - Write in clean, structured markdown without code blocks.
    - Interpret only the chart features extracted by the reader task — do not invent or extrapolate beyond verified technical data.

    Subject Information:
    - Name: {name}
    - Date of Birth: {date_of_birth}
    - Location of Birth: {birthplace}

  expected_output: >
    A richly layered, thematically organized psychological interpretation of the subject's natal chart, weaving verified technical structure into coherent developmental narratives, formatted clearly in markdown for downstream integration.
