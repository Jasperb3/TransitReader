  description: >
    Synthesize the extracted transit analysis, natal chart analysis, and transit-to-natal activation analysis into a cohesive, psychologically developmental astrological interpretation, integrating technical precision, symbolic richness, and practical life relevance.

    Planning and Synthesis Workflow:
    1. **Foundational Review – Natal Chart**:
        - Summarize chart shape, diurnality, dominant/lacking elements and modalities, and natal Moon phase.
    2. **Foundational Review – Current Transits**:
        - Summarize transit chart shape, diurnality, dominant elements and modalities, and current Moon phase emotional tone.
    3. **Structural Comparison**:
        - Assess resonance and dissonance between natal and transit structures.
        - Establish the overall energetic context: tension, reinforcement, or rebalancing themes.
    4. **Identify Cyclical Markers**:
        - Check for any active Planetary Returns (Saturn, Jupiter, Nodes, Chiron).
        - Note active Solar Return or Lunar Return themes if provided.
    5. **Extract Key Transit-to-Natal Aspects**:
        - List significant aspects from transiting planets to natal planets/angles.
        - Prioritize outer planet activations, angular hits, Sun/Moon/Personal Planets activations, and hard aspects within tight orbs (<3° preferred).
    6. **Identify Key House Activations**:
        - Highlight any natal houses strongly activated by transiting outer planets or key ingresses.
    7. **Note Intensification Factors**:
        - Identify any transits triggering natal stelliums, transit stelliums overlaying sensitive points, and eclipse activations impacting natal placements.
    8. **Interpret High-Priority Individual Transits**:
        - Analyze core psychological and symbolic meanings of the top 2–3 most powerful transit-to-natal activations.
    9. **Synthesize into Core Developmental Themes**:
        - Identify 2–4 overarching psychological or archetypal storylines arising from the combined transit climate, natal foundations, and personal activations.
    10. **Assess Timing Arcs and Intensity**:
        - Map expected activation windows, peak intensities (e.g., stations, exact aspects), and resolution phases.
    11. **Frame Developmentally**:
        - Situate the activations within the client’s broader psychological and life-stage journey, distinguishing probable event triggers from deeper internal evolution.
    12. **Formulate Insights and Life Guidance**:
        - Summarize core psychological challenges, growth opportunities, and developmental tasks per theme.
        - Offer empowering, psychologically informed guidance that emphasizes conscious agency and strategic engagement.
    13. **Ethical Review**:
        - Ensure interpretations respect client autonomy, psychological safety, and avoid deterministic or fear-based framing.
    14. **Synthesize Theme Interactions**:
        - Briefly analyze how the 2-4 core developmental themes might interact or influence each other during this period.

    Output Instructions:
    - Structure the report following modular progression:
      - Transit Climate Overview
      - Natal Foundations Summary
      - Personalized Developmental Themes (2–4 themes)
      - Technical Overview of Activations
      - Practical Life Guidance per theme
    - Explicitly anchor all interpretations in verified technical data: degrees, signs, houses, aspects, dignities, planetary conditions, motion status.
    - Use clear modular markdown formatting (logical heading hierarchy) without code blocks to enable seamless downstream CrewAI processing.

  description: >
    Transform the synthesized astrological interpretation into a polished, psychologically resonant, client-centered report that empowers practical navigation of the current astrological landscape.

    Report Structure:
    1. **Cover Page**:
        - Present subject information clearly (Name, Birth Data, Current Location, Report Date).
        - Insert standardized '[transit_chart]' placeholder under the main title.
    2. **Introduction**:
        - Briefly explain the report's purpose: mapping current collective energies, individual predispositions, and personal developmental themes.
        - Emphasize astrology as a symbolic, empowering, and choice-centered tool.
    3. **Transit Climate Overview**:
        - Summarize key energetic patterns and psychological themes visible in today's transit-to-transit configurations.
        - Highlight elemental and modality emphases shaping the collective atmosphere.
        - Describe the emotional tone suggested by the current Moon phase and outer planet activity.
    4. **Subject’s Natal Foundation**:
        - Outline dominant natal chart traits influencing the subject's response to current energies.
        - Focus on elemental distribution, modality balance, and major natal configurations or patterns.
    5. **Personalized Developmental Themes (Transit-to-Natal Focus)**:
        - Detail 2–4 core psychological and life-development themes emerging from current transit activations of natal planets, houses, and angles.
        - Structure each theme as a modular subsection, including:
            - Title reflecting the psychological arc (e.g., "Emotional Reinvention and Relational Clarity").
            - Activation details (transiting planet, natal planet/angle, house domain, aspect type, orb).
            - Interpretation of internal growth potentials and probable external life expressions (probabilistic, not deterministic).
            - Estimated timing arcs (start, peak, resolution phases), factoring retrogrades and stations.
    6. **Technical Overview for Active Themes**:
        - Provide a concise, tabular or bullet-point technical summary for all major transits, aspects, degrees, houses, dignities, and motion states.
    7. **Actionable Life Guidance**:
        - Offer 1–3 practical, psychologically grounded recommendations per major theme.
        - Tie each recommendation explicitly to the activated natal life domains and archetypal dynamics.
        - Emphasize timing sensitivity (when to act, reflect, release) and emotional agency.
    8. **Conclusion**:
        - Summarize the overarching growth potentials and challenges identified in the report using clear, accessible, everyday language.
        - Reinforce empowerment, resilience, and conscious choice as key guiding principles.

    Tone and Style Guidelines:
    - Maintain scholarly astrological integrity while writing in an emotionally intelligent, accessible, and non-deterministic style.
    - Weave technical data fluently into the narrative without interrupting thematic flow.
    - Use clear modular markdown structure (logical headings, subheadings) with no code blocks.
