    Synthesize the extracted transit analysis, natal chart analysis, and transit-to-natal activation analysis into a cohesive, psychologically developmental astrological interpretation, integrating technical precision, symbolic richness, and practical life relevance.

    Planning and Synthesis Workflow:
    1. **Foundational Review – Natal Chart**:
        - Summarize chart shape, diurnality, dominant/lacking elements and modalities, and natal Moon phase.
    2. **Foundational Review – Current Transits**:
        - Summarize transit chart shape, diurnality, dominant elements and modalities, and current Moon phase emotional tone.
    3. **Structural Comparison**:
        - Assess resonance and dissonance between natal and transit structures.
        - Establish the overall energetic context: tension, reinforcement, or rebalancing themes.
    4. **Identify Cyclical Markers**:
        - Check for any active Planetary Returns (Saturn, Jupiter, Nodes, Chiron).
        - Note active Solar Return or Lunar Return themes if provided.
    5. **Extract Key Transit-to-Natal Aspects**:
        - List significant aspects from transiting planets to natal planets/angles.
        - Prioritize outer planet activations, angular hits, Sun/Moon/Personal Planets activations, and hard aspects within tight orbs (<3° preferred).
    6. **Identify Key House Activations**:
        - Highlight any natal houses strongly activated by transiting outer planets or key ingresses.
    7. **Note Intensification Factors**:
        - Identify any transits triggering natal stelliums, transit stelliums overlaying sensitive points, and eclipse activations impacting natal placements.
    8. **Interpret High-Priority Individual Transits**:
        - Analyze core psychological and symbolic meanings of the top 2–3 most powerful transit-to-natal activations.
    9. **Synthesize into Core Developmental Themes**:
        - Identify 2–4 overarching psychological or archetypal storylines arising from the combined transit climate, natal foundations, and personal activations.
    10. **Assess Timing Arcs and Intensity**:
        - Map expected activation windows, peak intensities (e.g., stations, exact aspects), and resolution phases.
    11. **Frame Developmentally**:
        - Situate the activations within the client’s broader psychological and life-stage journey, distinguishing probable event triggers from deeper internal evolution.
    12. **Formulate Insights and Life Guidance**:
        - Summarize core psychological challenges, growth opportunities, and developmental tasks per theme.
        - Offer empowering, psychologically informed guidance that emphasizes conscious agency and strategic engagement.
        - Identify concrete, relatable scenarios and experiences readers might encounter (for Real-World Signals).
        - Generate meaningful self-inquiry questions tied to each theme (for Reflective Questions).
    13. **Identify Practical Applications**:
        - Note quick-start practices (5-10 minutes) that readers can begin immediately.
        - Identify emergency protocols for intense emotional moments.
        - Suggest daily micro-practices tied to major themes.
    14. **Ethical Review**:
        - Ensure interpretations respect client autonomy, psychological safety, and avoid deterministic or fear-based framing.
    15. **Synthesize Theme Interactions**:
        - Briefly analyze how the 2-4 core developmental themes might interact or influence each other during this period.

    Output Instructions:
    - Structure the report following modular progression:
      - Transit Climate Overview
      - Natal Foundations Summary
      - Personalized Developmental Themes (2–4 themes)

  description: >
    Transform the synthesized astrological interpretation into a polished, psychologically resonant, client-centered report that empowers practical navigation of the current astrological landscape.

    Report Structure:
    1. **Cover Page**:
        - Present subject information clearly (Name, Birth Data, Current Location, Report Date).

        - Structure each theme as a modular subsection, including:
            - Title reflecting the psychological arc (e.g., "Emotional Reinvention and Relational Clarity").
            - Activation details (transiting planet, natal planet/angle, house domain, aspect type, orb).
            - Interpretation of internal growth potentials and probable external life expressions (probabilistic, not deterministic).
            - **Questions for Reflection** (2-4 open-ended prompts that invite personal self-inquiry):
                - Tie questions directly to the psychological growth path of this theme
                - Frame as invitations to exploration, not diagnostic assessments
                - Include at least one question about timing or readiness (e.g., "What needs to complete before you can move forward?")

        - Provide a concise, tabular or bullet-point technical summary for all major transits, aspects, degrees, houses, dignities, and motion states.
        - Include a reassuring transition if complexity is high (e.g., "If you're newer to astrology, focus on the themes above—this section is for technical reference.").
    9. **Actionable Life Guidance**:
        - Offer 1–3 practical, psychologically grounded recommendations per major theme.
        - Tie each recommendation explicitly to the activated natal life domains and archetypal dynamics.
        - Emphasize timing sensitivity (when to act, reflect, release) and emotional agency.
        - Frame guidance as choices and invitations, not prescriptions.
    10. **Conclusion**:
        - Summarize the overarching growth potentials and challenges identified in the report using clear, accessible, everyday language.
        - Reinforce empowerment, resilience, and conscious choice as key guiding principles.
        - Include a warm closing acknowledgment of the reader's journey (e.g., "Trust yourself as you navigate this passage...").

    Tone and Style Guidelines:
    - Maintain scholarly astrological integrity while writing in an emotionally intelligent, accessible, and non-deterministic style.
    - Weave technical data fluently into the narrative without interrupting thematic flow.
    - Use clear modular markdown structure (logical headings, subheadings) with no code blocks.
    - Include conversational bridging language between major sections that acknowledges the reader's journey through complex material.
    - Acknowledge complexity and offer reassurance when presenting challenging material (e.g., "I know this is dense—let's break it down step by step...").
    - Remind readers of their agency in engaging with the content (e.g., "Choose which themes resonate most and start there...").
    - Use second person ("you") to create intimate connection while maintaining professionalism.
    - Create natural "breathing room" in dense sections with transitional sentences that orient and encourage.

    **Language Precision Requirements**:
    - Replace vague qualifiers: "can" → "typically," "may" → "tends to," "often" → "characteristically"
    - Use active agency: "tests your assumptions" not "assumptions are tested," "compels you to" not "you may be pushed to"
    - Prefer concrete psychological terms: "transformative pressure," "systemic reorganization," "integration phase," "psychological after-effects," "residual activation"
    - Limit metaphoric language: Use "crucible," "alchemy," "compost" sparingly (max once per major theme); alternate with direct terms
    - Keep sentences under 40 words for readability
    - Link orbs to interpretive weight: "With a tight 0.67° orb, this influence is immediate and inescapable"
    - Reference activating planets in guidance: "Under Pluto's conjunction to Mercury, your thinking restructures under pressure"
    - Add micro-headers within long theme sections: "Technical Summary," "Psychological Implications," "Practical Expression"
    - Add brief italicized context lines under guidance blocks (e.g., "*These steps consolidate the mental restructuring underway*")
    - Define technical terms once in parentheticals: "Out of Bounds (beyond the Sun's maximum declination, intensifying independence)"

    **Technical Formatting Standards**:
    - Orb precision: Always two decimal places (e.g., "Orb: 3.45°" not "Orb: 3.4°")
    - Degree symbol: Use ° (not 0°), with no space before it (e.g., "14° Leo" not "14 ° Leo")
    - Planet order: Consistent syntax "Transit Planet → Natal Planet, Orb: X.XX°, Applying/Separating"
    - Maintain causal continuity: Growth potentials must reflect exact symbolic tensions (e.g., "discipline versus transformation" for Saturn-Pluto)
